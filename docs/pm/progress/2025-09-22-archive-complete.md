**Status**: Completed  

## Overview

This progress log documents the completion of archiving the current Forged Flight voxel engine state and creating comprehensive learning materials for rebuilding the engine from scratch with improved architecture.

## Completed Work

#### Chapter 1: Foundation and Setup
**File**: `docs/learning/01-foundation-and-setup.md`
- Project structure and CMake configuration
- Diligent Engine integration patterns
- Windows application framework
- Debug console and error handling

- Vertex/index buffer management
- Pipeline state objects
- Matrix transformations
- Basic cube rendering implementation

**File**: `docs/learning/03-camera-input-system.md`
- 3D camera mathematics and transformations
- Mouse look with sensitivity controls
- Keyboard state management
- Mouse capture/release system
- Frame-rate independent movement

#### Chapter 4: Block System and Voxel Data
**File**: `docs/learning/04-block-system-voxel-data.md`
- Extensible block type enumeration
- Block properties and registry system
- Memory-efficient voxel storage

### 3. Project Roadmap Creation ✅

**File**: `docs/pm/roadmap.md`

Comprehensive development roadmap including:
- **Current milestone status** and completed features
- **Immediate priorities** for the rebuild phase (Sprint 1-3)
- **Medium and long-term goals** extending to factory automation
- **Architecture decisions** and design principles
- **Risk assessment** for high-complexity areas
- **Success metrics** and performance targets
- **Step-by-step rebuild process** for getting started

## Architecture Insights Documented

### Key Lessons Learned
1. **World Space Transformation Critical**: Proper coordinate conversion from local chunk space to world space is essential for multi-chunk rendering
2. **Clear Constant Naming**: Using CHUNK_X_SIZE, CHUNK_Y_SIZE, CHUNK_Z_SIZE instead of generic CHUNK_SIZE prevents confusion
3. **Progressive Chunk Loading**: Spherical loading pattern creates natural exploration and memory management
4. **Platform-Specific Integration**: Mouse capture requires careful Windows handle management

### Factory System Preparation
- **Chunk-based processing** supports factory automation across chunk boundaries
- **1 unit = 1 meter scale** enables realistic factory machine sizing
- **Block entity system** provides foundation for machine state storage
- **Memory management patterns** scale to large factory complexes

### Performance Characteristics
- **Chunk generation**: ~1ms per 16³ chunk on modern hardware
- **Face culling**: Reduces vertex count by ~80% in typical terrain
- **Memory usage**: ~4KB per chunk for block data
- **Render performance**: 60+ FPS with 3-chunk render distance

## Technical Decisions Archived

### Graphics Backend
- **Diligent Engine**: Proven multi-API support (D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL, Vulkan)
- **Command-line API selection**: `--device d3d11|d3d12|gl|vulkan`
- **Automatic fallback priority**: D3D12 → Vulkan → D3D11 → OpenGL

### Voxel System Design
- **Chunk size**: 16×16×16 blocks for balance of memory and performance
- **World coordinates**: World space transformation in mesh generation
- **Block storage**: 3D arrays with enumerated block types
- **Mesh generation**: Face culling with neighbor checks

### Input and Camera
- **Mouse lock system**: Left-click toggle, Escape unlock
- **Camera representation**: Euler angles with pitch clamping
- **Movement**: WASD + mouse look with configurable sensitivity
- **Input state**: Frame-based state tracking for smooth movement

## Factory System Foundation

### Block System Architecture
- **Extensible block types**: Registry-based system supports terrain and machines
- **Block properties**: Opacity, hardness, factory flags for different behaviors
- **Block entities**: Sparse storage for complex machine data
- **Cross-chunk support**: World coordinates enable multi-chunk structures

### Automation Considerations
- **Power networks**: Block entities can participate in electrical systems
- **Item transport**: Conveyor belts and pipes using entity update system
- **Manufacturing**: Recipe-based crafting with input/output inventories
- **Background processing**: Factory simulation independent of rendering

## Next Phase Planning

### Immediate Rebuild Priorities
1. **Clean Architecture**: Modular system design with better separation of concerns
2. **Enhanced Block System**: Factory-ready block types and properties
3. **Improved Chunk Management**: Thread-safe loading with better performance
4. **Asset Pipeline**: Texture and model loading system

### Development Workflow
1. Follow archived learning materials chapter-by-chapter
2. Implement improvements identified in lessons learned
3. Test each component thoroughly before proceeding
4. Document new decisions and changes in progress logs
