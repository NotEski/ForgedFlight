# 04 – Systems / Storage & Inventories
## Containers
- Clay vessels (food/water), wooden crates, metal lockers, silos (bulk), tanks (fluids), warehouse shelves.
- Each has **mass** & **volume** limits; stacking rules; label plates & filters.

## Fluids
- **Gas bullet tanks**, **Crude tanks**, **Produced-water tanks**.
- Level sensors (Low/High/High-High).
- **Reminder:** separators stall on **backpressure**—provide capacity or vent/flare.

## Warehousing & Orders
- Warehouse **Scanner** reveals global counts per faction.
- **Orders** turn into jobs (pick/place/haul) that route via ports; trains/vehicles can fulfill.

## Early Barrels
- Barrels/drums allow bootstrap logistics from oil pads & chemistry before pipes/trains.
