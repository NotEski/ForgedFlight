# 01 – Vision

## Elevator Pitch
A **physics-driven, voxel survival‑lite factory builder** where planets are **cube-sphere worlds** you can mine end‑to‑end, appearing as **spheres from space**. Start with flint and fire, bootstrap bronze → iron → steam → oil/plastics → nuclear, then **build rockets** and **automate interplanetary logistics**. Final goal: assemble an **Intergalactic Gate** to go home.

## Audience
- Players who enjoy **modded Minecraft**, **Factorio/Satisfactory**, **KSP**, and **Outer Wilds** pacing.
- Co-op friendly; solo viable; tinkering/automation fans.

## Tone
- **Grounded realism, not simulationist pain.** “Realistic enough” systems that are readable and fun.
- **Discovery & engineering**: you learn by building, with guardrails in UI.

## Success Criteria
- Moment-to-moment: clear goals, satisfying build/automation, meaningful upgrades.
- A believable **planet-to-space loop** that’s fun to iterate.
- **Factories run off-screen** without chunk loading (headless).
- Satisfying **vehicle/rocket construction** with physics feedback.
- **Team-based research** that doesn’t punish solo play.

## Aesthetic Anchors
- **Entities:** blocky silhouettes inspired by *Cobblemon*.  
- **Machines:** readable industrial look inspired by *Create* and *Immersive Engineering*.  
- **Geometry Rule:** **No curved things** (except planetary spheres); prefer faceted forms and hard edges.

## Inspirations & Non-goals
- **Inspired by:** Modded MC, Factorio/Satisfactory, KSP, DoctoRAT's **Reach for the Stars**, Outer Wilds (fast orbits).  
- **Non-goals:** Hardcore sim of power grids/fluids/orbits; fantasy magic.

## Session length target
- **60–120 minutes per milestone** (longer-burn).

## TODO
- Lock UI visual language and palette.
- Define music/soundscape anchors.
- Lock visual style bible (palette, pixel density, iconography).
