# 02 – Core Pillars

## Pillar 1: From Anvil to Orbit
Progression mirrors human tech: **Bronze → Iron → Steam → Oil/Plastics → Nuclear → Space**.  
*Implications:* Multi‑tree research; early in‑world crafting; late modular vehicles/rockets.

## Pillar 2: Cube-Sphere Worlds, Spherical Space
Planets use **cube-sphere geometry** for seamless voxel terrain yet render as **spheres** from orbit.  
*Implications:* Six-face projection to sphere; seamless traversal; day/night and seasons computed per latitude; scene handoff with haze; low‑res baked planet textures.

## Pillar 3: Automation that Persists
Factories keep running when you’re away via **invisible controllers** and **headless simulation**.  
*Implications:* World‑interacting nodes request chunk loading; processing zones run off‑screen; trains virtualize between stations.

## Pillar 4: Survival that Nudges, Not Blocks
Survival systems exist to **encourage automation**, not gate it.  
*Implications:* Oxygen on home world; off‑world O₂ needed; hazards (lead/arsenic) matter; seasons weather vibe (optional gameplay effects).

## Pillar 5: Clear UI, Permissive Controls
Themed UIs (Satisfactory‑leaning) with **pixel‑art** clarity; **permissive rebinding** (multi‑bind, conflicts allowed).  
*Implications:* Overlays for heat/cold/starvation; debug tools; recipe ghosts discoverable.

**[OPEN]** Are there any immutable narrative beats beyond the Gate home goal?  
**TODO:** Add screenshots/mockups as UI solidifies.
