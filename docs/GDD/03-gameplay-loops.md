# 03 – Gameplay Loops

## Core Loop
**Gather → Craft → Survive → Optimize/Automate → Research → Repeat.**  
On new planets, **O₂** becomes the survival driver; seasons change conditions but **don’t reset** bases.

### Milestones
- **Copper Age** (First set of metal tools, the start of Black Smithing)
- **Bronze Age** (First automations become available with processing ores as well as creating a water wheel)
- **Iron Age**
- **Steel Age**
- **Steam** (mechanical expansion)
- **Electricity** (grid + machines)
- **Trains** (bulk logistics unlock)
- **Oil** (refining start)
- **Cars & trucks** (local haulage)
- **Airships** (early aerial)
- **Planes** (fast aerial logistics)
- **Computers** (automation & control)
- **Nuclear** *(optional branch)*
- **Space age** (orbital access)
- **Fusion** (high-end power)
- **Off-planet research** sci-fi research
	- have a few teirs in here that are sci fi that gets the player as well as off world space ship building and the like
- **Gate construction**
### Exit Criteria (Core)
- Crafted tools for current tier
- Stable food/heat/shelter
- First automation online
- Next research node unlocked

## Early Loop (Tier 0 → Bronze)
- Flint tools, campfire/forge, basic shelter.  
- Interim **MC/TFC‑style** crafting: 2×2/3×3 + stations (forge/anvil/kiln/knapping).  
- **Exit:** water/animal/wind power; Research Table available.

## Mid Loop (Iron → Steam → Oil/Plastics)
- Mechanical shafts/gears; steam; early trains; electricity.  
- Refineries; plastics; aviation; computing/automation.  
- **Exit:** reliable power/logistics; MV/HV tiers online; satellite access.

## Late Loop (Nuclear → Space)
- Advanced power; physics vehicles; rockets & stations; interplanetary logistics.  
- **Exit:** Gate components assembled; story completion → sandbox continue.

## Difficulty & Realism
- Presets: **Easy, Normal, Hard, Ultra**, plus **Custom sliders** (can reach “Ultra Super Hard”).  
- Sliders affect survival strictness, hazards, durability, machine upkeep, and orbital realism.

**TODO:** Detail **progression gates** for each tier (items, labs, research costs).  
**[OPEN]** What’s the intended pace for “first launch to orbit” on Normal?
