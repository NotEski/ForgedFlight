# AI Learning Materials Creation Guide

## Purpose

This README provides guidance for AI assistants to create high-quality, progressive learning materials for the Forged Flight voxel engine project. It ensures consistency, completeness, and pedagogical effectiveness across all tutorial chapters.

## Project Context

**Forged Flight** is a voxel-based game engine similar to Minecraft, but specifically designed to support factory automation gameplay (similar to Factorio). The engine emphasizes:
- Performance-oriented C++ architecture
- Multi-API graphics support (D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL, Vulkan)
- Factory automation systems from early design phases
- Educational value for learning game engine development

### Code Example Standards

#### DO Include:
- **Minimal, focused examples** (10-30 lines max)
- **Complete context** for understanding
- **Error handling patterns**
- **Performance considerations**
- **Factory system hooks** where relevant

#### DON'T Include:
- Large code blocks that should be implemented by the user
- Complete file contents (reference archive instead)
- Platform-specific code without alternatives
- Outdated or deprecated patterns

#### Example Format:
```cpp
// Brief explanation of what this does
void ExampleFunction()
{
    // Key implementation details
    // Highlight important concepts
    
    // Note performance considerations
    // Show factory automation hooks
}
```

### Factory System Integration

**CRITICAL**: Every chapter must consider how the content supports factory automation:

- **Chapter 1-4**: Foundation that supports automation (architecture, data structures)
- **Chapter 5-7**: World systems that scale to large factories
- **Chapter 8-9**: Gameplay mechanics that enable building
- **Chapter 10+**: Direct factory automation implementation

#### Factory Considerations Template:
```markdown
## Factory System Considerations

### 1. **[System] Foundation**
How this chapter's content enables factory features:
- Specific capability 1
- Specific capability 2

### 2. **Scalability**
Performance considerations for large factories:
- Memory usage patterns
- Processing requirements

### 3. **Integration Points**
Where factory systems will connect:
- API hooks
- Data structure extensions
```

## Technical Standards

### C++ Code Standards
- **Modern C++17/20** features where appropriate
- **RAII patterns** for resource management
- **Smart pointers** (RefCntAutoPtr for Diligent, unique_ptr for game objects)
- **Const correctness** and clear ownership
- **Exception safety** with proper cleanup

### Architecture Principles
- **Modularity**: Systems should be loosely coupled
- **Testability**: Each component should be unit testable
- **Performance**: Target 60+ FPS with complex scenes
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new block types, machines, features
- **Maintainability**: Clear interfaces and documentation

### Graphics Programming
- **Multi-API Support**: Code should work with D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL, Vulkan
- **Resource Management**: Proper buffer and texture lifecycle
- **Performance**: Efficient vertex data, minimal draw calls
- **Modern Techniques**: Use contemporary graphics programming patterns
