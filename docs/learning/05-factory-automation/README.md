# Factory Automation - Core Gameplay Systems

This section implements the factory automation systems that define Forged Flight's unique gameplay.

## Planned Learning Path
1. **12-power-systems.md** - Electrical networks and energy management (Future)
2. **13-item-transport.md** - Conveyor belts and logistics networks (Future)
3. **14-manufacturing.md** - Assemblers, recipes, and production chains (Future)
4. **15-automation-logic.md** - Circuit networks and programmable controllers (Future)
5. **16-factory-optimization.md** - Performance optimization for large factories (Future)

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Gameplay Mechanics section
- Understanding of network/graph algorithms
- Basic knowledge of production system design

## Learning Objectives
- Implement electrical power distribution networks
- Create efficient item transport systems
- Design flexible manufacturing and recipe systems
- Build automation logic and control systems
- Optimize performance for large-scale factories

## Game Design Integration
This section directly implements the factory automation vision:
- Power systems from the Game Design Document
- Logistics networks supporting complex supply chains
- Manufacturing systems with realistic production timelines
- Automation that enables hands-off factory operation

## Next Section
Proceed to **06-optimization** for performance tuning and advanced techniques.
