# Graphics & Rendering - Visual Foundation

This section covers the graphics pipeline, camera system, and basic rendering capabilities.

## Learning Path
1. **02-graphics-pipeline-rendering.md** - Shaders, pipeline states, and basic geometry
2. **03-camera-input-system.md** - 3D camera, mouse look, and input handling

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Foundation section
- Basic understanding of 3D graphics concepts
- Familiarity with matrix transformations

## Learning Objectives
- Implement multi-API graphics pipeline using Diligent Engine
- Create flexible camera system with FPS-style controls
- Understand vertex/index buffers and GPU resource management
- Master 3D transformations and projection matrices

## Factory System Preparation
The rendering foundation supports:
- Efficient rendering of large numbers of factory machines
- Camera systems for factory overview and management
- GPU resource patterns that scale to complex automation

## Next Section
Proceed to **03-world-systems** to implement the voxel world foundation.
