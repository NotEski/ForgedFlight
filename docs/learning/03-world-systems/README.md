# World Systems - Voxel Foundation

This section covers the voxel world architecture, block systems, and chunk management.

## Learning Path
1. **04-block-system-voxel-data.md** - Block types, properties, and storage systems
2. **05-chunk-management-streaming.md** - World organization and memory management (Future)
3. **06-mesh-generation-optimization.md** - Efficient voxel rendering (Future)
4. **07-terrain-generation.md** - Procedural world creation (Future)

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Graphics & Rendering section
- Understanding of 3D coordinate systems
- Basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms

## Learning Objectives
- Design extensible block type systems
- Implement efficient voxel storage and access patterns
- Create chunk-based world organization
- Understand memory management for large worlds

## Factory System Foundation
World systems provide the foundation for:
- Multi-block factory structures spanning chunks
- Block entities for machine state storage
- Efficient serialization for factory persistence
- Cross-chunk automation networks

## Next Section
Proceed to **04-gameplay-mechanics** to add player interaction systems.
