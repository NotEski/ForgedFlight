# Foundation - Core Engine Setup

This section covers the fundamental setup and architecture of the Forged Flight engine.

## Learning Path
1. **01-foundation-and-setup.md** - Project structure, CMake, and Diligent Engine integration

## Prerequisites
- C++ 17/20 knowledge
- Basic understanding of game engines
- Development environment setup (Visual Studio, CMake, Git)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the overall engine architecture
- Set up a clean, modular project structure
- Integrate Diligent Engine for multi-API graphics support
- Establish debugging and error handling patterns

## Factory System Preparation
The foundation establishes architectural patterns that will support:
- Modular system design for factory automation
- Performance-oriented patterns for large-scale simulation
- Cross-platform compatibility for server deployment

## Next Section
Proceed to **02-graphics-rendering** to implement the rendering pipeline.
