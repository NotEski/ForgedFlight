# Gameplay Mechanics - Player Interaction

This section covers player interaction systems, building mechanics, and user interface.

## Planned Learning Path
1. **08-block-interaction-gameplay.md** - Block breaking/placing, raycasting (Future)
2. **09-inventory-system.md** - Item storage and management (Future)
3. **10-building-tools.md** - Construction aids and blueprint system (Future)
4. **11-user-interface.md** - ImGui integration and game UI (Future)

## Prerequisites
- Completion of World Systems section
- Understanding of ray-object intersection
- Basic UI/UX design concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Implement precise block interaction using raycasting
- Create flexible inventory and item systems
- Design building tools that support large constructions
- Integrate debugging and development UI systems

## Factory System Bridge
Gameplay mechanics bridge to factory automation:
- Building tools become blueprint placement systems
- Inventory systems support automated item transport
- UI systems provide factory monitoring and control
- Block interaction supports machine configuration

## Next Section
Proceed to **05-factory-automation** for automation system implementation.
