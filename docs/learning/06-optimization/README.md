# Optimization - Performance & Polish

This section covers performance optimization, memory management, and rendering efficiency.

## Planned Learning Path
1. **17-rendering-optimization.md** - GPU optimization, batching, LOD systems (Future)
2. **18-memory-management.md** - Efficient allocation patterns and pooling (Future)
3. **19-threading-concurrency.md** - Multi-threaded chunk loading and factory simulation (Future)
4. **20-profiling-debugging.md** - Performance analysis and optimization tools (Future)

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Factory Automation section
- Understanding of performance analysis
- Knowledge of multi-threading concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Optimize rendering for large worlds and complex factories
- Implement efficient memory management patterns
- Design thread-safe systems for background processing
- Master profiling tools and optimization techniques

## Performance Targets
- 60+ FPS with large factories (1000+ active machines)
- < 2GB memory usage for large worlds
- < 50ms chunk generation time
- Smooth factory simulation at 20 TPS

## Next Section
Proceed to **07-advanced-topics** for specialized features and polish.
