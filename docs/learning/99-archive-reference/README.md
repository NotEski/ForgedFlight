# Archive & Reference Materials

This section contains archived implementations, troubleshooting guides, and reference materials.

## Contents
- **00-voxel-engine-archive.md** - Complete archive of the original working implementation
- **02-cube-rendering-solutions-comparison.md** - Analysis of different rendering approaches

## Purpose
These materials serve as:
- **Historical Reference** - Working code patterns from the original implementation
- **Troubleshooting Guide** - Solutions to common problems encountered during development
- **Architecture Analysis** - Lessons learned and design decisions
- **Debugging Resources** - Step-by-step problem solving approaches

## When to Use
- When rebuilding systems, reference the archive for proven patterns
- When encountering rendering issues, check the cube rendering solutions
- When making architectural decisions, review lessons learned
